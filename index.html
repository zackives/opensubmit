<p>This is OpenSubmit, a small web application for managing student
assignment solutions in a university environment.</p>

<p>Other tools, such as Moodle, are more powerful and support not only
assignments, but also the management of learning material, course
progress and access rights. If you want the all-inclusive solution, this
is the wrong project.</p>

<p>OpenSubmit offers a trivial web page were <em>students can login and submit
their assignment solutions</em>. Teachers and their personal use the backend
interface to manage assignments, deadlines, and the gradings. Students
are informed about the progress of their correction and their final
grade via eMail and the frontend page.</p>

<p>The unique capability of OpenSubmit is the <em>support for coding
assignments</em>, were students upload their programming exercise solution
as source code archive. OpenSubmit offers an executor daemon that runs 
on another machine and downloads submitted solutions from the
web server. These archives are unpacked and compiled, so
that non-compiling assignment solutions are rejected by the system
before the deadline. You can also run an assignment-specific validation
script that figures out if the student code behaves nicely, before accepting
it as solution. This makes the life of the corrector less
miserable, because after the deadline, all gradable solutions are
‘valid’. Students also seem to like the idea of having a
validated solution, so that they do not fail due to technical
difficulties at the correctors side.</p>

<p>When the deadline is over, the system can run another invisible test with the
student code the determine grading-relevant information.</p>

<p>Since OpenSubmit is only for assignment submission, it has no elaborated management
of course participants. Everybody who can perform a successful login can
submit solutions. Therefore, we expect you to have an institute-specific 
authentication provider. OpenSubmit currently supports OpenID and Shibboleth
out of the box for such cases. You can also offer GitHub, Twitter or Google login
for determining the student identity. A third option is to integrate OpenSubmit
via LTI in an existing learning management system (LMS).</p>
